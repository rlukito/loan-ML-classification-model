# loan-classification-model
LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending company that directly connects borrowers and potential lenders/investors.
In this exercise, I build classification models (KNN, Decision Tree) to predict whether a loan provided by LendingClub is likely to be a non-performing loan,
i.e. whether the loan will potentially go into default.
